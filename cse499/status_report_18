###### Accomplishments:
Fixed the footer tab bar for the app and worked on development for the budget system and recommendation set up.

###### Challenges:
Staying on schedule, but all the areas I have listed above have been in the development process and have clear work already done for it, our goal for this week is to finish those goals that are pending by the end of this new week.

###### Plans / Goals for next week:
Go over what needs to be done this wee with ammon and work hard and even do some paired programming together.

###### Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
Working in a team has motivated me to continue on.
