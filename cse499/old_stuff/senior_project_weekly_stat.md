### Project Title: RateThePlace

### Project Description:
RateThePlace, is an app centered around to improve the quality of life of people. This project aims to
help those that want/interested to know, the thoughts and opinions from others, about areas, cities, and neighborhoods.
The app will contain a rating system based on different categories, so that the person looking at the reviews can look for 
the categories that apply to them. They are also able to review the comments/reviews made by other people about said area. 
The app will integrate Navigation Tools (like GoogleMaps) so that you can easily find said place and view the ratings and reviews. 
For the ability to make a review/rating about a place, it is required, to have proof of having been there or be in a decent distance ratio of
said area to upload your thoughts.
