###### Accomplishments:
I was able to develop and make all the visualization assets we need for the app in Adobe Xd, so now all the visualizations will be unique. Implemented the look and feel of the User Preferences page and made sure to go over each page we need with my team member Ammon.

###### Challenges:
Now that we have all the assets we need (and if I need to make more I can in Adobe Xd) Some of the things like the group implemention pushed back a little bit, but I know I'll be able to deliver.

###### Plans / Goals for next week:
Go over the updates implemented with Ammon and work hard to finish the group implementation and hopefully the Location and plan recommendations.

###### Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
Working in a team has motivated me to continue on.
