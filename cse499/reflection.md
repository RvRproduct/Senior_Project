### Roberto Reynoso
#### Senior Project Reflection

* Briefly describe your project: Reunion is an app that will be a one stop shop for setting up family reuions or friend get togethers without having to deal with all the extra steps of planning. This app will make it easier than ever to get your reunions set-up.
&nbsp;

* How did you meet, exceed, or fall short of your original expectations? I feel as though we met all our expectations, we got all the designing all out of the way, so now all there is left to do, is to program it.
&nbsp;

* What changes were made to your project during the process? We were thinking if we couldn't figure out 2factor auth or gps, we would try to work around that. We had originally planned on using reactas our main technology, but settled on flutter and dart instead.
&nbsp;

* What were the most important/interesting lessons learned about the new computer science topics you learned about? Learning how to create a mobile app! This is a door that I have wanted open for a while. So I am glad to be doing it with a team member.
&nbsp;

* What were the most important/interesting lessons learned about the project itself? I found it really interesting that Flutter is a very heavy widget based system, which is something to get used to.
&nbsp;

* What were the most important/interesting lessons learned about yourself? I learned that throughout the semester I got better at juggling different assignments. I was able to balance things at a decent rate, which I want to continue improving at.
&nbsp;

* Final Thoughts: I am excited to continue working on this with Ammon (team-member) Over the Summer and Over Next semester.
